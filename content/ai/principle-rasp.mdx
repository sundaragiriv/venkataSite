**Why it works.** Guardrails + retrieval tame variance while preserving the creative power of LLMs for complex business scenarios.

**Implementation.** Use SAP's Change Data Capture (CDC) to maintain fresh context in vector stores, then retrieve relevant business rules before LLM processing.

**Anti-pattern.** Direct API access without governance leads to data leaks and unpredictable system behavior.

**Example.** Service ticket routing that considers customer history, product configuration, and technician availability through retrieved SAP context.
