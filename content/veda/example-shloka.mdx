**Reflection.** In modern teams, अहिंसा shows up as psychological safety—creating environments where people can express ideas without fear of judgment or retaliation.

**Application.** When architecting systems, we practice अहिंसा by designing for graceful degradation rather than catastrophic failure, ensuring our technical decisions don't harm user experience or business continuity.

**Wisdom.** True strength in leadership comes not from force, but from creating conditions where everyone can contribute their best work.
