**Sanskrit Context.** This verse from the Mahabharata speaks to the four purusharthas (life goals) that guide human existence. In technology leadership, these translate to ethical practice, sustainable business value, passion for innovation, and freedom from technical debt.

**Modern Application.** When making architectural decisions in SAP implementations:

- **Dharma (Righteousness)**: Choose solutions that serve users genuinely, not just business metrics
- **Artha (Prosperity)**: Ensure technical decisions create lasting business value
- **Kama (Desire)**: Maintain passion for elegant, innovative solutions
- **Moksha (Liberation)**: Free teams from legacy constraints and technical debt

**Leadership Wisdom.** The best SAP architects balance these four aspects—they build systems that are ethically sound, financially viable, technically exciting, and liberating for future development.

**Practical Example.** In a recent S/4HANA migration, applying dharmic principles meant:
- Transparent communication about risks (dharma)
- ROI-focused feature prioritization (artha) 
- Innovative use of BTP capabilities (kama)
- Clean architecture enabling future flexibility (moksha)
