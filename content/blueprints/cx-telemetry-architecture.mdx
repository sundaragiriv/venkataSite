## Executive summary
A telemetry-first approach turns operational noise into actionable signals. For CX platforms this means instrumenting customer interactions end-to-end: UI, middleware (CPI/BTP), commerce events, and support tickets. This blueprint gives an event taxonomy, recommended schema, ingestion pattern, and governance checklist for building ML-ready telemetry.

## Problem statement
Many CX programs are blind to the rich event data emitted across channels and systems. Data fragmentation prevents rapid detection of experience degradation and hinders ML experiments. A telemetry-first architecture standardizes events, enforces schemas, and creates reliable pipelines for analytics and inference.

## Architecture & event flow
**Core components**
- **Event producers**: Commerce Cloud, Service Cloud, web/mobile UX, third-party partners.  
- **Ingestion layer**: Kafka/Kinesis or BTP Event Mesh; schema registry (Avro/JSON Schema).  
- **Enrichment/feature layer**: BTP processing, joins to customer master (CDC), and enrichment services.  
- **Storage & analytics**: cold store (data lake) + hot store (OLAP) + feature store for ML.  
- **Consumer layer**: dashboards, Joule inference, analytics jobs, alerts.

Event flow diagram (high-level):  

```
Producer -> Event Mesh (schema validated) -> Enricher -> Feature Store / Data Lake -> Consumers (Analytics / ML / Alerts)
```

## Event taxonomy & recommended schema (example)
**Core event types**
- `interaction.view` — page/product view  
- `cart.change` — item added/removed  
- `checkout.order` — order placed  
- `support.ticket` — new ticket or update  
- `recommendation.view` — personalization impression

**Minimal JSON schema example**
```json
{
  "eventType":"interaction.view",
  "timestamp":"2025-10-30T12:00:00Z",
  "user": {"id":"U-123", "segment":"lapsed"},
  "payload": {"pageId":"SKU-001","referrer":"email"},
  "meta": {"source":"commerce", "env":"prod"}
}
```

## Implementation steps (6)
1. **Define event taxonomy & schema registry** — decide canonical event types and schemas; register them in a schema registry.
2. **Instrument producers** — update Commerce and Service Cloud adapters, web SDKs, and middleware to publish validated events.
3. **Implement ingestion & enrichment** — use Event Mesh + BTP processors to enrich events (customer master, product metadata).
4. **Feature store integration** — materialize commonly used features for ML experimentation.
5. **Analytic surfaces & alerts** — dashboards, anomaly detectors, and real-time alerts for business KPIs.
6. **Governance & retention** — schema versioning, PII handling, retention policies.

## Monitoring & ops
- Track event delivery SLA, schema error rates, and consumer lag.
- Implement automated schema compatibility checks on deploy.
- Provide replay & reprocessing tools for backfills.

## Pilot plan & KPIs
- Pilot: instrument 3 producer sources (web, commerce, support) → ingest into event mesh → route to analytics & Joule.
- KPIs: schema validation failure under 1%, event end-to-end latency under 1s, event coverage over 90% for targeted flows.
