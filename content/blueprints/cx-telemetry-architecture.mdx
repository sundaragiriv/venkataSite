**DRAFT BLUEPRINT**

## Problem, Solution & Outcomes

This blueprint transforms SAP CX implementations from deployment-focused to outcome-driven by implementing telemetry-first architecture. Measure business impact from day one with real-time KPI tracking and feedback loops.

## Architecture Overview

**Data Flow**: SAP Events → CDC → Event Hub → Analytics → Dashboards → ML Insights → Process Optimization

**Key Components**:
- Event streaming infrastructure
- Real-time analytics layer
- KPI dashboard framework
- ML-powered insights engine

## Implementation Steps

1. **KPI Definition**: Establish 3-5 baseline measurements
2. **Event Streaming**: Wire SAP events to analytics layer
3. **Dashboard Creation**: Build real-time monitoring
4. **Feedback Loops**: Connect metrics to development priorities
5. **ML Integration**: Add predictive insights
6. **Process Optimization**: Continuous improvement cycles

## Key Metrics & Impact

- **48-hour case resolution** (from 72-hour baseline)
- **3% SLA breaches** (from 15% baseline)
- **Real-time visibility** into CX performance
- **Data-driven optimization** cycles

## Next Steps

1. **Download** the complete architecture blueprint (PDF)
2. **Schedule** a telemetry planning session
3. **Review** related Signals for implementation insights
