**DRAFT BLUEPRINT**

## Problem, Solution & Outcomes

This blueprint provides three proven patterns for integrating AI into SAP landscapes without breaking existing processes or budgets. Focus on specific, measurable problems rather than trying to "boil the ocean."

## Three Proven Patterns

**1. Retrieval-Augmented Processes (RAP)**
- Inject governed SAP context into AI decisions
- Example: Service ticket routing using customer history + product config
- ROI: 40% reduction in escalations, 25% faster resolution

**2. Policy-Guarded Automation**
- AI suggests, humans approve, system learns
- Example: CPQ pricing recommendations with business rule validation
- ROI: 60% faster quotes, 90% fewer pricing errors

**3. Telemetry-Driven Insights**
- AI analyzes patterns in SAP event streams
- Example: Predictive maintenance using FSM + IoT data
- ROI: 30% reduction in unplanned downtime

## Implementation Steps

1. **Pattern Selection**: Choose appropriate pattern based on use case
2. **Pilot Implementation**: Start with one process, measure everything
3. **Governance Setup**: Implement proper controls and validation
4. **Integration Architecture**: Build secure, scalable connections
5. **Monitoring & Optimization**: Continuous improvement cycles
6. **Scaling Strategy**: Expand gradually with proven patterns

## Key Metrics & Impact

- **40% reduction in escalations** (RAP pattern)
- **60% faster quotes** (Policy-Guarded Automation)
- **30% reduction in downtime** (Telemetry-Driven Insights)
- **Proven ROI** across multiple SAP environments

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Direct LLM â†’ SAP API calls without governance
- AI-first approaches without human oversight
- Complex solutions for simple problems
- Deployment without proper measurement

## Next Steps

1. **Download** the complete patterns blueprint (PDF)
2. **Schedule** an AI integration planning session
3. **Review** related Signals for implementation insights
