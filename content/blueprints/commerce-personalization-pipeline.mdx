# Commerce Personalization Pipeline

## Problem

Retail and commerce teams struggle to deliver high-quality personalized offers at scale without exploding latency and engineering effort. Broad personalization leads to low precision; narrow tactical segmentation works but is hard to operationalize.

## Architecture (short)

CDP → Event Stream (Kafka/CDC) → BTP preprocessing (CPI adapters) → Feature store → Joule inference endpoint → Commerce Cloud personalization API. Cache top-N results per user for 60s.

## Implementation Steps (5)

### 1. Define event contract (schema) for all personalization triggers

Define event contract (schema) for all personalization triggers (cart, browse, purchase, price-change).

### 2. Build real-time event stream

Build real-time event stream from CDP into BTP ingestion service (CPI connectors).

### 3. Create light-weight ranking model

Create light-weight ranking model (item score = base_score * recency_factor * affinity_weight). Host behind Joule with JSON input/output contract.

### 4. Integrate inference into Commerce UI

Integrate inference into Commerce UI with a 250ms SLA and 60s caching layer.

### 5. Run A/B pilot

Run A/B pilot on two small segments for 2 weeks, measure CTR and conversion lift.

## Data Contract example (JSON snippet)

```json
{
  "userId": "string",
  "sessionId": "string",
  "events": [{"type":"view","itemId":"SKU123","timestamp":1660000000}],
  "context": {"currency":"USD","region":"NA"}
}
```

## KPIs

- CTR lift on personalized offers (target 25–40% for pilot)
- Conversion lift in targeted CTA segments (target 15–25%)
- Latency impact < +200ms (with caching)

## Ops checklist

- Canary rollout with feature flagging
- Monitor recommendation precision and fallback to best-sellers if confidence < 0.35
- Periodic model refresh every 48–72 hours in early phase
