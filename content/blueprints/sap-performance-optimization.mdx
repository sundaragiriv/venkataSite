**DRAFT BLUEPRINT**

## The 80/20 Performance Stack

Most SAP performance tuning advice focuses on exotic edge cases while ignoring the fundamentals that deliver massive improvements with minimal effort. This blueprint identifies the critical 20% of optimizations that deliver 80% of performance gains.

### Database Layer (40% of Impact)
**High-Impact Optimizations:**
- **Composite Indexes**: Create indexes for frequent query patterns (2-hour implementation, 50% query improvement)
- **Table Partitioning**: Partition large tables by date/business unit (1-day setup, 70% scan reduction)
- **Statistics Updates**: Automated weekly statistics refresh (30-minute setup, 30% query optimization)
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimize database connections (1-hour config, 25% resource savings)

### Application Server (25% of Impact)
**Critical Configurations:**
- **Memory Management**: Right-size work processes and buffers (2-hour tuning, 40% memory efficiency)
- **Parallel Processing**: Implement parallel RFC calls (4-hour development, 60% batch improvement)
- **Caching Strategy**: Application-level reference data caching (1-day implementation, 80% lookup speed)

### Network & Integration (20% of Impact)
**Essential Optimizations:**
- **Payload Optimization**: Send only required fields (2-hour code review, 50% bandwidth reduction)
- **Compression**: Enable gzip for large transfers (30-minute config, 70% size reduction)
- **Connection Reuse**: Pool external system connections (4-hour implementation, 40% latency improvement)

### Quick Wins Checklist
- [ ] Replace SELECT * with specific field lists
- [ ] Implement batch processing for bulk operations (1000-record chunks)
- [ ] Add client-side caching for reference data (1-hour TTL)
- [ ] Configure proper work process sizing
- [ ] Enable compression for API responses
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Establish baseline metrics before optimization
- [ ] Create automated performance regression tests

**Implementation Priority:**
1. **Week 1**: Database indexing and statistics
2. **Week 2**: Application server memory tuning
3. **Week 3**: Caching implementation
4. **Week 4**: Network optimization and monitoring

**Success Metrics:**
- Response time under 1 second for 95% of transactions
- 80% reduction in slow-running queries
- 50% improvement in system throughput
- 60% reduction in resource consumption
