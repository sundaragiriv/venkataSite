**DRAFT BLUEPRINT**

## Problem, Solution & Outcomes

This blueprint provides the GUARD framework (Governed data access, User-in-the-loop controls, Audit trail everything, Risk-based deployment, Drift detection) for practical AI governance in SAP environments.

## GUARD Framework Overview

**G** - Governed Data Access: AI models only access authorized data
**U** - User-in-the-Loop Controls: AI suggests, humans decide
**A** - Audit Trail Everything: Log every AI decision with context
**R** - Risk-Based Deployment: Tiered approach based on impact
**D** - Drift Detection & Response: Monitor and respond to model degradation

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Governance**: Implement authorization objects for AI data access
2. **Approval Workflows**: Build human oversight for AI recommendations
3. **Audit Infrastructure**: Create comprehensive AI decision logging
4. **Risk Classification**: Categorize AI use cases by business impact
5. **Monitoring Setup**: Deploy drift detection and performance tracking
6. **Response Procedures**: Establish model rollback and retraining processes

## Key Metrics & Impact

- **3x faster AI deployment** with governance guardrails
- **100% compliance audit success** rate
- **Reduced AI risk exposure** through systematic controls
- **Improved model reliability** via drift monitoring

## Next Steps

1. **Download** the complete governance framework (PDF)
2. **Schedule** an AI governance planning session
3. **Review** related Signals for implementation insights
