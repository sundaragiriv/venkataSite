## Problem

Sales teams were spending hours on manual pricing rules and complex configuration, causing long quote cycles and errors that impacted revenue and customer satisfaction.

## Solution Overview

Integrated Sales Cloud V2 with CPQ using BTP for orchestration and Joule for recommendations. The architecture includes event streaming, CPI adapters and a small inference endpoint for upsell recommendations.

**Key Components:**
- Sales Cloud V2 with persona-driven workflows
- CPQ pricing engine with automated rules
- BTP integration layer for data orchestration  
- Joule inference endpoint for intelligent upsells
- Real-time analytics dashboard for quote performance

## Implementation Steps

1. **Assessment & Planning** (Week 1-2)
   - Current state analysis of sales processes
   - Pricing rule inventory and complexity mapping
   - Integration touchpoint identification

2. **Core Integration** (Week 3-6) 
   - Sales Cloud V2 configuration and persona setup
   - CPQ pricing engine implementation
   - BTP middleware and CPI adapters

3. **AI Enhancement** (Week 7-8)
   - Joule endpoint configuration for recommendations
   - ML model training on historical sales data
   - A/B testing framework for upsell optimization

4. **Go-Live & Optimization** (Week 9-12)
   - Pilot rollout with select sales teams
   - Performance monitoring and KPI tracking
   - Iterative improvements based on user feedback

## Measurable Outcomes

- **Quote-to-order time reduced by 60%** — from 4.2 days to 1.7 days average
- **Configuration error rate reduced by 90%** — from 12% to 1.2% error rate
- **Seller onboarding time reduced by 3 weeks** — streamlined training process
- **Upsell attachment improved by 23%** — via intelligent Joule recommendations
- **Customer satisfaction up 15%** — faster, more accurate quotes

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Data Quality**: Implement data validation rules and cleansing workflows
- **User Adoption**: Comprehensive training program and change management
- **Integration Complexity**: Phased rollout approach with thorough testing
- **Performance**: Load testing and scaling strategies for peak usage
