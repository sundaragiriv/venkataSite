**DRAFT BLUEPRINT**

## Problem, Solution & Outcomes

This blueprint addresses the challenge of migrating legacy CRM action profiles to Service Cloud V2's modern workflow engine. The solution reframes triggers as declarative policies with AI validation and telemetry guardrails.

## Architecture Overview

**Migration Flow**: Legacy Action Profiles → Policy Analysis → Service V2 Workflows → AI Validation → Deployment

**Key Components**:
- Policy extraction and analysis engine
- Service V2 workflow orchestration
- AI-powered conflict detection
- Telemetry and monitoring framework

## Implementation Steps

1. **Legacy Analysis**: Inventory existing action profiles and trigger logic
2. **Policy Reframing**: Convert triggers to declarative policy statements
3. **Service V2 Setup**: Configure workflow engine and orchestration
4. **AI Validation**: Implement conflict detection and consistency checking
5. **Migration Execution**: Phased rollout with monitoring
6. **Optimization**: Continuous improvement based on telemetry

## Key Metrics & Impact

- **TBD** - Migration error reduction percentage
- **TBD** - Policy deployment time improvement
- **TBD** - Workflow execution efficiency gains

## Next Steps

1. **Download** the complete migration blueprint (PDF)
2. **Schedule** a migration planning session
3. **Review** related Signals for implementation insights
