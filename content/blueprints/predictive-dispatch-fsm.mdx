## Problem

Operations teams face high emergency dispatch volume and low first-time-fix (FTF) rates. Root causes include poor triage, missing contextual signals, and reactive scheduling.

## Solution Pattern

Ingest ticket history, asset telemetry (IoT), and environmental signals to predict dispatch urgency and required skills. Use a lightweight classifier to score tickets and map to FSM dispatch profiles.

## Implementation Steps (5)

### 1. Aggregate historical tickets + IoT feature set

Aggregate historical tickets + IoT feature set; create a labeled dataset for emergency vs. non-emergency.

### 2. Feature engineering

Feature engineering: last-reported severity, asset age, failure rate, customer SLA tier.

### 3. Train classification model

Train classification model; deploy behind Joule or a small inference service with confidence scores.

### 4. Integrate with SAP FSM via CPI

Integrate with SAP FSM via CPI: predicted priority → create/update work order → recommended skillset in work order notes.

### 5. Pilot on subset of regions

Pilot on subset of regions and monitor emergency dispatch reduction and FTF.

## KPIs

- Emergency dispatch reduction (target 12–25% in pilot)
- FTF improvement (target +20%)
- Dispatch latency reduction (time from ticket to scheduled visit)
