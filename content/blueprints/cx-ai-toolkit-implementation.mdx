**DRAFT BLUEPRINT**

## Problem, Solution & Outcomes

This blueprint demonstrates AI-driven case routing using CX AI Toolkit with Service Cloud V2. Combines sentiment analysis, intent classification, and Joule-powered agent assistance to dramatically improve case handling efficiency.

## Architecture Overview

**AI Flow**: Case Creation → Sentiment Analysis → Intent Classification → Joule Assistance → Optimized Routing → Agent Support

**Key Components**:
- CX AI Toolkit for sentiment and intent analysis
- Service Cloud V2 workflow orchestration
- Joule integration for agent assistance
- Real-time case routing optimization

## Implementation Steps

1. **CX AI Toolkit Setup**: Configure sentiment analysis and intent classification
2. **Service Cloud V2 Integration**: Build workflow orchestration layer
3. **Joule Configuration**: Implement agent assistance capabilities
4. **Routing Logic**: Create intelligent case assignment algorithms
5. **Agent Training**: Prepare support teams for AI-assisted workflows
6. **Performance Monitoring**: Track KPIs and optimization opportunities

## Key Metrics & Impact

- **65% reduction in case transfers** through better initial routing
- **30% improvement in first-contact resolution** via AI assistance
- **20% increase in customer satisfaction** from faster resolution
- **Reduced agent training time** with intelligent assistance

## Manufacturing Client Results

- **40% of service cases** previously required multiple transfers
- **AI-driven routing** eliminated most transfer scenarios
- **Agent efficiency** improved significantly with contextual assistance
- **Customer experience** enhanced through faster, more accurate support

## Next Steps

1. **Download** the complete implementation blueprint (PDF)
2. **Schedule** a CX AI planning session
3. **Review** related Signals for implementation insights
