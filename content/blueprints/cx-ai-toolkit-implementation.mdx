## Executive Summary
This blueprint defines a practical, production-ready implementation of AI-driven CX tooling for case routing, intent classification, and Joule-based inference in SAP CX landscapes. It balances model simplicity, observability, and robust fallback behavior to ensure enterprise readiness.

## Problem Statement
Case routing and classification in large contact centers is time-consuming, inconsistent, and often dependent on manual rules. Pure rules-based systems lack scale; monolithic ML projects are heavy. The CX AI Toolkit approach uses small, focused models + Joule inference to deliver predictable, measurable improvements and clear operational boundaries.

## Architecture & Components
**Components**
- **Ingest layer**: events, transcripts, and message metadata from Service Cloud / Messaging channels.  
- **Feature service**: ephemeral feature assembly via BTP microservice + feature store for heavier features.  
- **Model catalog**: small, purpose-built models (intent classifier, priority scorer, ETA estimator).  
- **Inference host**: Joule endpoints for low-latency inference (SLA 100–250ms).  
- **Decision engine**: combine model outputs + business rules to create routing decisions and actions.  
- **Observability & explainability**: inference telemetry, confidence tracking, sample traces.

Architecture pattern (high-level):

```
Service Cloud -> Ingest -> Feature Service -> Joule (inference) -> Decision Engine -> Service Cloud (assign work)
```

## Implementation Steps
1. **Define scoped use-cases** — e.g., triage inbound cases by intent (billing, outage, returns). Start with 1–2 high-value intents.  
2. **Collect labeled data** — sample transcripts and past routing decisions. Label at scale using a small labeling sprint.  
3. **Train minimal models** — intent classifier (text), priority scorer (tabular), using lightweight architectures for speed.  
4. **Contract & endpoint design** — define JSON input/output contracts for Joule inference. Include confidence score and explainability snippets.  
5. **Integrate with Service Cloud** — CPI connectors or BTP events trigger inference calls and write decisions back to the work item.  
6. **Rules & fallbacks** — implement a decision table that uses model confidence to choose model-driven route or fallback to business rule.  
7. **Operate & iterate** — telemetry-driven retraining cadence, drift detection, and A/B experiments.

## Inference Contract Example
```json
{
  "requestId":"uuid-xxxxx",
  "text":"Customer: I can't access my account since yesterday",
  "context":{"channel":"chat","customerTier":"Gold"},
  "response": {
    "intent":"AccountAccess",
    "confidence":0.92,
    "recommendedRoute":"AccountSecurityQueue",
    "explain":[{"token":"access","weight":0.45}, {"token":"account","weight":0.32}]
  }
}
```

## Pilot Plan & Evaluation
- Pilot scope: 2 intent categories, 4-week duration, live A/B or shadow mode.
- Metrics: routing accuracy, SLA compliance, mean handle time (MHT), successful resolution % within SLA.
- Acceptance: over 10% SLA improvement or over 20% reduction in manual routing overhead.

## Operations & Governance
- Implement model versioning and automatic rollback when drift/latency breaches defined thresholds.
- Store inference logs for 30–90 days for audit & training.
- Implement throttling and circuit-breakers to protect service endpoints.

## KPIs & Expected Outcomes
- Routing automation rate: aim for 40–60% of inbound cases for pilot intents.
- SLA improvement target: +15–25% for routed cases.
- Latency: 95th percentile inference under 250ms.
