**The Reality Check.** Most SAP AI initiatives fail not because of technology limitations, but because teams try to boil the ocean instead of solving specific, measurable problems.

**Three Patterns That Work:**

**1. Retrieval-Augmented Processes (RAP)**
- Inject governed SAP context into AI decisions
- Example: Service ticket routing using customer history + product config
- ROI: 40% reduction in escalations, 25% faster resolution

**2. Policy-Guarded Automation**
- AI suggests, humans approve, system learns
- Example: CPQ pricing recommendations with business rule validation
- ROI: 60% faster quotes, 90% fewer pricing errors

**3. Telemetry-Driven Insights**
- AI analyzes patterns in SAP event streams
- Example: Predictive maintenance using FSM + IoT data
- ROI: 30% reduction in unplanned downtime

**The Anti-Pattern:** Direct LLM → SAP API calls without governance. This creates compliance nightmares and unpredictable behavior.

**Next Steps:** Start with one process, measure everything, expand gradually. AI in SAP is a marathon, not a sprint.
