**Principle.** अहिंसा (ahiṁsā) means non-violence, but in workplace contexts it's about creating conditions where people can contribute without fear of judgment or retaliation.

**Practice.** In code reviews, focus on the code's impact rather than the coder's knowledge. Instead of "This is wrong," try "This approach might cause performance issues under load—here's an alternative that scales better."

**Architecture.** When designing systems, practice ahiṁsā by building for graceful degradation rather than catastrophic failure. Ensure technical decisions don't harm user experience or business continuity.

**Result.** Teams become more willing to experiment, ask questions, and share early drafts when they know feedback will be constructive rather than punitive.
