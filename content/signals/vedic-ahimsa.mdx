**Observation.** The harshest code reviews often come from a place of caring—we want the codebase to be excellent. But aggressive feedback can shut down learning and collaboration.

**Vedic principle:** अहिंसा (ahimsa) teaches us that true strength comes from creating conditions where everyone can thrive, not from demonstrating superiority.

**Practice:** In code reviews, focus on the code's impact rather than the coder's knowledge. Instead of "This is wrong," try "This approach might cause performance issues under load—here's an alternative that scales better."

**Result:** Teams become more willing to experiment, ask questions, and share early drafts when they know feedback will be constructive rather than punitive.
