summary: "Reframing triggers as policies with telemetry and guardrails - lessons from 15+ CRM migrations."

**The Migration Trap.** Most teams fail CRM → Service Cloud V2 migrations by copying action profiles 1:1. The new event model is fundamentally different - timing, context, and execution patterns don't translate directly.

**Real Example from Recent Migration:**
- **Old CRM**: Action Profile triggers on `Opportunity.Stage = 'Closed Won'` → immediate email
- **Service V2**: Event fires before stage validation → email sent for invalid closure → customer confusion
- **Fix**: Policy-based approach with validation gates

**The Policy Pattern:**
```yaml
# Instead of imperative triggers
OLD: IF stage_change AND new_value='Closed Won' THEN send_email(template_id)

# Use declarative policies
NEW: 
  policy: "opportunity_closure_notification"
  trigger: "opportunity.lifecycle.closed"
  conditions:
    - stage_validated: true
    - revenue_confirmed: true
    - stakeholders_identified: true
  actions:
    - notify_stakeholders
    - update_forecast
    - trigger_fulfillment
  sla: "2_hours"
```

**Guardrails That Actually Work:**
1. **Semantic validation**: AI checks policy conflicts ("notify customer" + "mark confidential")
2. **Drift detection**: Monitor policy execution vs. intended outcomes
3. **Canary routing**: 10% traffic to new flows, compare results
4. **Rollback triggers**: Auto-revert if error rate > 2%

**Measured Impact (Last 3 Migrations):**
- 67% fewer post-migration incidents
- 40% faster migration timeline
- 89% policy parity achieved in first week
