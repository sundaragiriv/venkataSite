summary: "Reframing triggers as policies with telemetry and guardrails."

**Challenge.** Migrating CRM action profiles to Service Cloud V2 breaks when you replicate exact trigger logic. The new system has different event models and timing.

**Reframe.** Treat actions as declarative policies that describe *what should happen when* rather than *how to make it happen*. Let the platform's orchestration engine handle execution details.

**Example.** Instead of "When opportunity stage = Closed Won, send email template X to contact Y", write "Policy: Closed opportunities require stakeholder notification within 2 hours" and let Service Cloud V2's workflow engine determine optimal execution.

**Guardrails.** Use AI to validate policy consistency across migration, flagging conflicts before production. Add telemetry to measure policy effectiveness and drift over time.
