**Thesis.** Treat actions as policies, not triggers. When migrating CRM action profiles to Service Cloud V2, the temptation is to replicate the exact same trigger logic. This breaks because the new system has different event models and timing.

**Better approach:** Define actions as declarative policies that describe *what should happen when* rather than *how to make it happen*. Let the new platform's orchestration engine handle the execution details.

**Example:** Instead of "When opportunity stage = Closed Won, send email template X to contact Y", write "Policy: Closed opportunities require stakeholder notification within 2 hours" and let Service Cloud V2's workflow engine determine the optimal execution path.

**Guardrails:** Use AI to validate policy consistency across the migration, flagging conflicts before they reach production.
