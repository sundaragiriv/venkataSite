Pilot insight: a two-week pilot using ticket history + basic feature engineering fed into a lightweight classifier produced an 18% reduction in emergency dispatches and a 22% improvement in first-time-fix rates. The stack was intentionally minimal: event ingestion from tickets, light pre-processing, a Joule-hosted inference endpoint, and a small rule layer in FSM that surfaced flagged cases to dispatch planners.
