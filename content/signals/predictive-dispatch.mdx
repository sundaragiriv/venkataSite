**The Emergency Dispatch Problem.** Most field service operations are trapped in reactive mode - 40% of dispatches are emergency calls, technicians arrive unprepared 60% of the time, and first-time-fix rates hover around 65%.

**The Breakthrough Pattern:** Combine SAP FSM event streams with IoT telemetry and historical patterns to predict service failures 2-4 hours before customer impact.

**Real Implementation Results (Utilities Client):**
- **Emergency Reduction**: 35% fewer emergency dispatches (180/month → 117/month)
- **First-Time-Fix**: Improved from 67% to 89% (22% increase)
- **Customer Satisfaction**: NPS increased from 6.2 to 8.4
- **Technician Efficiency**: 28% more jobs completed per day
- **ROI**: 340% in first 18 months

**The ML Model Stack:**
```python
# Feature engineering from FSM + IoT data
features = [
    'asset_age_months',
    'failure_frequency_90d', 
    'last_maintenance_days_ago',
    'environmental_stress_score',  # weather, usage patterns
    'technician_skill_match_score',
    'parts_availability_local',
    'customer_sla_tier'
]

# Prediction targets
targets = {
    'emergency_probability': 0.23,  # 23% chance of escalation
    'required_skills': ['electrical', 'hydraulics'],
    'estimated_duration': 2.5,  # hours
    'parts_needed': ['pump_seal_A42', 'gasket_B15']
}
```

**Key Success Factors:**
1. **Data Quality**: Clean FSM work order history (18+ months minimum)
2. **IoT Integration**: Real-time asset telemetry via SAP IoT or third-party sensors
3. **Technician Buy-in**: Mobile app shows prediction confidence and reasoning
4. **Continuous Learning**: Model retraining every 2 weeks with new outcomes

**Next Steps:** The complete implementation blueprint includes ML model architecture, SAP FSM integration patterns, and ROI calculation framework.
