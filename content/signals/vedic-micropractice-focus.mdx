Micro-insight: a 7-minute morning practice (breath cadence + two short reflection prompts) ran as a voluntary experiment across a small engineering pod for one week. Participants reported improved single-task focus and fewer context switches; measured slack interruptions fell 14% during first two hours. This is an accessible, team-friendly practice intended to be shared as a short audio and a one-page cheat sheet.
