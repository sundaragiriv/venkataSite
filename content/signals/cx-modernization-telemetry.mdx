**The Problem.** Most SAP CX projects are measured by "go-live" success, not business impact. Teams celebrate deployment, then wonder why adoption stagnates and ROI remains elusive.

**The Solution: Telemetry-First Design**

**Before You Code:**
- Define 3-5 KPIs with baseline measurements
- Wire event streams from SAP to analytics layer
- Create feedback loops between metrics and development priorities

**Example: Service Cloud V2 Implementation**
- **Baseline:** 72-hour average case resolution, 15% SLA breaches
- **Telemetry:** Real-time case routing, agent workload, customer satisfaction
- **Outcome:** 48-hour resolution (-33%), 3% SLA breaches (-80%)

**The Architecture:**
```
SAP Events → CDC → Event Hub → Analytics → Dashboards
                              ↓
                         ML Insights → Process Optimization
```

**Key Insight:** When teams see their impact in real-time, they optimize differently. Telemetry transforms behavior, not just systems.

**Implementation Tip:** Start with one golden path (e.g., case creation → resolution). Perfect the measurement, then expand to adjacent processes.
