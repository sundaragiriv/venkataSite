summary: "Quick prototype integrated Joule inference into CPQ for personalized upsell recommendations during quote creation."
---

Quick result: a short prototype that called a Joule inference endpoint during the CPQ flow produced contextual upsell suggestions. In a controlled internal test, inclusion of a single, relevant upsell increased add-on attach rate by ~12% and shortened seller decision time by ~6 seconds on average. The prototype used cached signals and a simple confidence threshold so the UI only showed high-probability recommendations.
