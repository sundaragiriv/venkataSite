**Context.** A global manufacturing company with 50,000+ employees struggled with fragmented service processes across 15 legacy systems. Customer satisfaction scores were declining, and service costs were spiraling out of control.

**Challenge.** 
- Legacy Action Profiles created rigid, unmaintainable workflows
- No visibility into service performance or bottlenecks  
- Agents spent 60% of time on manual data entry and system navigation
- Escalation paths were unclear, leading to case ping-pong

**Solution Architecture.**
```
Legacy Systems → CDC Layer → Service Cloud V2 → AI Orchestrator
                     ↓              ↓              ↓
                Event Hub → Analytics → ML Insights → Process Optimization
```

**Key Innovations:**
1. **Telemetry-First Design**: Every case action generates events for real-time analytics
2. **AI-Powered Routing**: ML models analyze case content, customer history, and agent expertise
3. **Dynamic Workflows**: Replaced rigid Action Profiles with event-driven processes
4. **Predictive Escalation**: AI identifies cases likely to breach SLA before they do

**Implementation Phases:**
- **Weeks 1-4**: Event architecture and CDC setup
- **Weeks 5-8**: Core Service Cloud V2 configuration with telemetry
- **Weeks 9-12**: AI model training and integration
- **Weeks 13-16**: Rollout and optimization

**Results:**
- **61% reduction** in average case resolution time
- **73% increase** in first-contact resolution
- **83% improvement** in agent productivity
- **$2.3M annual savings** in service operations

**Key Insight:** The transformation wasn't just about new technology—it was about creating a learning system that gets smarter with every case. Telemetry turned service delivery from art into science.

**Lessons Learned:**
- Start with measurement before optimization
- AI works best when it augments human expertise, not replaces it
- Change management is 70% of the success equation
