**Context.** A Fortune 500 retailer with $15B revenue operated 12 disconnected systems: SAP ECC, Salesforce, Shopify, Oracle WMS, custom loyalty platform, and 7 regional POS systems. Data inconsistencies were causing $50M annual revenue leakage.

**Challenge.**
- Point-to-point integrations created a maintenance nightmare (67 connections)
- Customer data scattered across systems with no single source of truth
- Inventory visibility gaps led to stockouts and overstock situations
- Manual reconciliation processes took 40+ hours weekly

**Solution: Event-Driven Integration Hub**
```
Systems → CPI → Event Mesh → Real-time Processing → Business Actions
   ↓         ↓        ↓             ↓                    ↓
Legacy → Transform → Route → Enrich/Validate → Distribute → Act
```

**Architecture Principles:**
1. **Event-First**: Every business event (sale, return, inventory change) flows through the hub
2. **Canonical Data Model**: Single customer/product/inventory schema across all systems
3. **Intelligent Routing**: Events routed based on content, not destination
4. **Self-Healing**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff and dead letter queues

**Key Components:**
- **CPI Flows**: 23 integration flows handling 2M+ events daily
- **Event Mesh**: Real-time event distribution with guaranteed delivery
- **Data Services**: Master data management with conflict resolution
- **Monitoring**: Real-time dashboards with predictive alerting

**Implementation Journey:**
- **Phase 1**: Core CPI setup and 3 critical integrations (ECC, Salesforce, WMS)
- **Phase 2**: Event mesh deployment and real-time inventory sync
- **Phase 3**: Customer 360 implementation across all touchpoints
- **Phase 4**: Advanced analytics and predictive capabilities

**Business Impact:**
- **95% reduction** in integration delivery time
- **Real-time data** across all customer touchpoints
- **93% decrease** in integration errors
- **$12M recovered revenue** from improved inventory accuracy
- **80% reduction** in manual reconciliation effort

**Technical Achievements:**
- Processing 2.3M events daily with 99.97% uptime
- Sub-second data propagation across 12 systems
- Zero-downtime deployments with blue-green strategy
- Automatic scaling handling 10x traffic spikes during Black Friday

**Innovation Highlight:** Built a "Digital Twin" of customer journey that updates in real-time as customers interact across any channel. This enabled personalized experiences that increased conversion by 34%.

**Lessons for SAP Architects:**
- Event-driven beats request-response for complex integrations
- Invest in monitoring and observability from day one
- Design for failure—systems will break, make them resilient
- Business value comes from data velocity, not just data volume
