**Context.** Legacy CPQ rules slowed down quoting processes and introduced pricing errors that frustrated both sales teams and customers.

**Challenge.** The existing system required manual intervention for complex product configurations, leading to inconsistent pricing and delayed quote generation.

**Solution.** Implemented Sales Cloud V2 with integrated CPQ engine, automated pricing rules, and real-time validation through CPI middleware.

**Impact.** Reduced quote cycle time by 60% and pricing errors by 83%, resulting in improved sales velocity and customer satisfaction.
